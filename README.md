I’m excited to share my latest project, ATS Resume Expert! 🎓 This application leverages the power of Google Generative AI (Gemini) to analyze resumes against job descriptions, providing insightful feedback and calculating percentage matches. 📊

🔍 Key Features:

AI-Powered Analysis: Uses advanced generative models to evaluate resumes with precision.
HR & ATS Expertise: Mimics professional HR evaluations, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
